There was nothing that asked me to link the 2Welcome to Honeywell! I will be glad in assisting you. May just have a minute to pull up your account.sure thingThank you for waiting Mr. Rowland. May I know if you belong to a Transportation System Employee?I don't know what that is, so I guess not?I have not heard from you for some time.  Is there something that I may help you with?Oh I see.You asked if I belonged to a transportation system employee, and I replied that I don't know what that isI apologize, yes I got your answer.I am trying to understand how my payroll deductions make it into my Bank of America HSA that I set up, because there was no where in the setup process that asked me to link the two accounts togetherI can check that for you.Thank you for waiting, here is the process.Since you already elected your HSA, once eligibility information is received by Bank of America, you will receive a Welcome Packet to open the account.And once it is established your contribution which will be deducted from your payroll after 1-2 pay cycle will be credited.ok, the site however directed me to open the HSA directly with Bank of America, which I did independently.it never instructed me to wait for a packet in the mail. It said that no contributions can be made until Honeywell confirms that you have an account opened with BoABut it reflected here in our system that you elected for your HSA.Correct, that's what I electedbut on the confirmation screen, it gave me a warning that no contributions can be made until I opened an HSA with BoAand gave me a link to open the accountbut the account at BoA never asked me for an employer, a company code, etc.That is correct.I suppose once I receive the packet in the mail, I can call BoA to link the two?I just need to verify regarding Eligibility Information, may I have a minute please.sureThank you for waiting Mr. Rowland, as what I have mentioned earlier, since your election for HSA is reflecting here on our system, then we will send your Eligibility Information to Bank of America for you to receive a Welcome Packet from them.okIs there anything else, I can help you with today?no thank you\n",

However, the web site suggests calling Bank of America (the HSA card provider).  They were unable to confirm whether or not the transaction was recorded.  I believe the web site should be modified.Yes. That is also correct if the transaction was not successful you will need to call Bank of America to send another One Time contribution for Health Savings Account.Is there anything else I can assist you with?Typically a web site should provide some confirmation page , pop-up, etc. to indicate a submission was received.  I hope you will put this in the suggestion box.That is rest assured.Is there anything else I can assist you with?Thank you.\n",
